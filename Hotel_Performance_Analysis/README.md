**1. Introduction**
This report analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) for hotel properties across multiple cities and platforms. The data dashboard provides insights into revenue, occupancy rates, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and realization percentages, helping stakeholders optimize hotel operations and maximize profitability.

**2. Data Overview**
The dashboard presents aggregated hotel performance data across different parameters, including:
- Revenue
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- Occupancy %
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)
- Realisation %
- DSRN, DBRN, and DURN (presumably related to room nights booked or utilized)

**3. Key Metrics Analysis**

**3.1 Revenue & RevPAR**
- The total revenue across properties is **1.69 billion**.
- The RevPAR is **7.34K**, indicating a healthy revenue generation per available room.

**3.2 Occupancy and ADR**
- Overall occupancy stands at **57.79%**.
- The ADR is **12.70K**, which suggests a premium pricing strategy.

**3.3 Realisation Percentage**
- The realisation percentage is **70.14%**, reflecting the proportion of expected revenue that is actually realized.
- Realisation varies by booking platform, with the highest ADR observed in direct offline bookings.

**4. Comparative Analysis**

**4.1 Day Type Comparison**
- **Weekend:** Occupancy is **73.90%**, with an ADR of **12,724.03**, yielding a higher RevPAR of **9,403.25**.
- **Weekday:** Occupancy drops to **51.34%**, with a slightly lower ADR of **12,679.47**, leading to a lower RevPAR of **6,509.88**.

**4.2 City-Wise Property Performance**
- Properties in **Mumbai** and **Delhi** contribute the highest revenues.
- Hyderabad and Bangalore properties show strong occupancy rates but slightly lower ADR.

**5. Trends and Insights**
- **Seasonality Impact:** The occupancy trends over time suggest fluctuations aligned with demand patterns.
- **Luxury vs. Business Segments:** Business hotels have slightly lower occupancy rates than luxury properties.
- **Platform Performance:** Direct offline bookings have the highest ADR, whereas online travel agents (OTAs) contribute lower ADR but higher occupancy rates.

**7. Recommendations**
1. **Optimize Pricing Strategy**: Leverage peak occupancy periods to adjust ADR dynamically.
2. **Enhance Direct Booking Channels**: Invest in marketing to increase direct bookings, which yield higher ADR.
3. **City-Specific Strategies**: Implement city-focused promotions where occupancy is lower.
4. **Weekend Packages**: Encourage weekday bookings with discounts or corporate tie-ups.

**8. Conclusion**
This data-driven approach enables hotel operators to refine strategies for revenue maximization and enhanced guest satisfaction. Further granular analysis can help improve forecasting and decision-making.
